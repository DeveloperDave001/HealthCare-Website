                The BDIC- Benue State Digital Infrastructure Company platform allows a cross connect across  diverse facilities. 
                This allows continuation of care irrespective of the 
                traditional hospital or related facility  of the patient. 
                This means he or she is not seen as a stranger even at first visit at other hospitals or related facilities within or outside Benue State. 
                Each facility has its own admin class. These groups 
                of people are responsible for the determination of access 
                rights to other employees. 
                User Accounts can be activated, stopped and monitored. It is not the responsibility of staff of BDIC to carry this burden since the number of clients on the platform has the tendency to escalate very easily .
                In addition to this, BDIC is not preview to the internal recruitment processes and exits at these facilities

                <span class="headtextformobile">    Why SWHMIS</span> <br>
                While the goal of BDIC is to unify Benue state based 
                hospital and other related facilities' in their 
                information flow, we must note that  those that 
                operate outside the state can also benefit from the 
                services once they are duly registered.
                The lessons learnt during the COVID19 pandemic has 
                shown that the use of technology to prevent and 
                fight disease threats proved very effective. 
                In addition to this, The Benue State Government 
                seeks to leverage the benefits of technology in 
                diverse areas especially in healthcare to deliver 
                safe and qualitative health care to citizens any 
                where they are. This includes continuation of care 
                from home, integration of paramedic services, remote 
                health monitoring and integration of other facilities like medical laboratories, pharmacies etc. This means patient’s information can be accessed during care by a remote pharmacy to guarantee safe dispensary of pharmaceutical products. This would eventually help to take health care insurance to the unreached and better served those already on the platform reducing wastages from government and patient perspective

                Electronic Health Care solutions is the new normal. 
                It prevents unnecessary deaths and helps with cutting
                 edge decision support system. Just imagine having 
                 access to your allergy charts, medications, family history, prior antenatal histories, etc . You can also have your laboratory results posted to your medical facility before you get there. This reduces patients waiting time and puts the hospital infrastructure into best use. Each Patient has a unique identification that can be used irrespective of you traditional hospital since your information is always available.
                The COVID19 pandemic is a typical scenario where 
                symptoms were clear indication of possibility of 
                infection
                It is also important to note that State Ministry of
                 Health, Primary Health care Board, Health Management
                  Board can also know at real-time current stock pile
                   of consumables like drugs to fight these diseases at each state hospitals thus preventing out-of-stock syndrome. It is essential to fight encounters before they evolve into  epidemic or pandemics . Critical information can also be sent to the federal and other donors  including WHO-World health Organization
